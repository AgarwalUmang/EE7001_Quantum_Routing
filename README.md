# SEQUENCE-Python

SEQUENCE-Python is a prototype version of official SEQUENCE release. We will use SEQUENCE-Python to demonstrate our design. To avoid confusion, we create a seperate repository to mange code for SEQUENCE-Python. 

Example code for the final version of the model can be found in "sequence.py", which relies on the unfinished parser.
Running code for the BB84 protocol can be found in "BB84.py".
